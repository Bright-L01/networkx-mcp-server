  - `import_from_source`: Multi-source data import (CSV, JSON, DB, API)
  - `batch_graph_analysis`: Parallel analysis of multiple graphs
  - `create_analysis_workflow`: Chain operations with caching
  - `generate_report`: PDF/HTML reports with visualizations

#### Production Features
- **Security Hardening**
  - Input validation prevents injection attacks
  - File operations sandboxed to safe directories
  - Memory limits (1GB) prevent DoS attacks
  - Rate limiting infrastructure
  - Disabled dangerous operations (pickle imports, eval)

- **Redis Persistence**
  - Automatic graph persistence on modifications
  - 100% data recovery across server restarts
  - Concurrent access protection
  - Configurable storage backends

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Handles 5+ concurrent users
  - P95 latency: 20-50ms for most operations
  - Memory efficient (<100MB for 10k node graphs)
  - Parallel processing support

- **Professional Architecture**
  - Clean modular design with Single Responsibility Principle
  - Plugin architecture for extensibility
  - Protocol-based interfaces
  - Factory patterns for component selection
  - 100% backwards compatible

- **Enterprise Features**
  - Health monitoring endpoints
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Comprehensive audit logging
  - Docker deployment ready
  - CI/CD pipeline configuration

### Documentation
- Complete API reference for all 39 tools
- Professional README with badges and examples
- Architecture overview and design principles
- Getting started guide
- Contributing guidelines
- Real-world examples (social, transport, citation networks)

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- Load capacity tests for concurrent users
- Redis persistence tests
- Security vulnerability tests
- Performance benchmarks

### Infrastructure
- Docker and docker-compose configuration
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Automated API documentation generation

### Security
- Graph ID validation with safe patterns
- File path sandboxing
- Format whitelisting for imports
- Secure error messages without stack traces
- No code execution (no eval/exec)

### Breaking Changes
- None (initial release)
- Note: Pickle format disabled for security (use GraphML/JSON instead)

### Known Issues
- Large graphs (>100k nodes) may require increased memory limits
- Some visualization layouts may be slow for dense graphs

### Contributors
- Initial implementation by NetworkX MCP Server team

### Acknowledgments
- Built on NetworkX library
- Uses FastMCP framework
- Implements Model Context Protocol specification
