# CI/CD Pipeline for networkx-mcp-server
# This workflow is designed for resilience and comprehensive feedback,
# inspired by the "Comprehensive CI/CD Fix Strategy Analysis".
# Key principles:
# 1. Continue-on-error is used strategically to ensure all jobs run and report errors.
# 2. Deprecated actions are avoided.
# 3. Tests are run across multiple Python versions and OSes.
