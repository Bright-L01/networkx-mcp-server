## v2.2.0 - Crisis Stabilization Complete (2025-01-16)

### üéØ Major Architectural Improvements

This release completes **Phase 1: Crisis Stabilization** of the NetworkX MCP Server strategic roadmap, resolving the "identity crisis" and focusing on core value delivery.

### ‚ú® What's New

#### Identity Clarity

- **Focused Mission**: Simplified from "enterprise security fortress" to "graph analysis in your AI conversations"
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Solve workflow fragmentation by enabling graph analysis directly in AI conversations
- **Streamlined Positioning**: Removed confusing enterprise/security messaging

#### Architecture Cleanup

- **Removed Security Fortress**: Eliminated 2,869 lines of unnecessary security theater
- **Removed Enterprise Bloat**: Deleted unused enterprise directory and features
- **Simplified Server**: Consolidated server_minimal.py to server.py (single entry point)
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed enterprise-specific dependencies

#### Improved Maintainability

- **Reduced Complexity**: From 3 server variants to 1 focused implementation
- **Better Test Coverage**: All 26 core tests passing consistently
