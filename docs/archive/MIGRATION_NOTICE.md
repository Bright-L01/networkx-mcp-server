# ⚠️ MIGRATION IN PROGRESS

We're transitioning from a complex 16,000-line implementation to a simple 150-line one that actually works.

## For Current Users

### Immediate Action Required: None

Your existing usage will continue to work. However, we strongly recommend migrating to the new implementation.

### To Use the New Implementation

```bash
export USE_MINIMAL_SERVER=true
# Then run as normal
```

### Benefits of Migrating

- **22% less memory usage** (37MB vs 47.7MB)
- **Better error messages** ("Graph 'test' not found. Available: ['graph1']")
- **Actually tested** (13 tests vs 0 working tests)
- **Actually deployable** (Docker works)

## Timeline

- **v0.1.3** (July 2024): Both implementations available
- **v0.2.0** (August 2024): Minimal becomes default, legacy shows warnings
- **v0.3.0** (September 2024): Legacy removed entirely

## What Changed?

### The Problem We Discovered

Our "minimal" server was:

- 909 lines (not minimal)
- 0% test coverage (claims of "comprehensive testing" were false)
- Couldn't be deployed (Docker builds failed)
- Used fake performance benchmarks (negative memory usage?)

### The Solution We Built

A **actually minimal** server that:

- 150 lines total
- 100% test coverage (13 tests, all pass)
- Deploys in Docker
- Has honest performance metrics

## Need Help?

1. **For migration questions**: See `MIGRATION_TO_MINIMAL.md`
2. **For technical issues**: Create a GitHub Issue
3. **For implementation comparison**: See `BRUTAL_COMPARISON.md`

## The Bottom Line

We're fixing a 16,000-line architectural mistake by replacing it with 150 lines that actually work. This is what "minimal" should have meant from the beginning.
