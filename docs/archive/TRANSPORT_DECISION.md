# Transport Decision: Stdio-Only for v0.1.0

## Executive Summary

After thorough testing and analysis, we've made the decision to **keep NetworkX MCP Server as stdio-only** for v0.1.0.

## The Reality Check

Running `test_http_reality.py` revealed:

- ❌ No `--transport` flag exists
- ❌ No HTTP implementation code
- ❌ No HTTP dependencies in requirements.txt
- ❌ "Dual-mode transport" was just aspirational

## Why Stdio-Only is the Right Choice

### 1. It Actually Works

Our comprehensive testing (`test_stdio_robustness.py`) proves stdio is rock-solid:

- ✅ Handles 9.6 requests/second
- ✅ Processes 1000+ node payloads
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Unicode support
- ✅ Stable lifecycle management

### 2. Industry Standard

- Most MCP servers start with stdio (Anthropic's reference implementations)
- Claude Desktop uses stdio for local servers
- Docker containers work perfectly with stdio

### 3. Simplicity = Reliability

- No network security concerns
- No authentication complexity
- No CORS/Origin header issues
- No session management overhead

## What We Changed

1. **Updated `__main__.py`**: Removed misleading "dual-mode transport" comment
2. **Created `TRANSPORT_REALITY.md`**: Documented the truth about transport support
3. **Added `test_stdio_robustness.py`**: Comprehensive stdio testing suite
4. **Removed `test_http_reality.py`**: After using it to verify HTTP doesn't exist

## HTTP Transport: Future Roadmap

When we implement HTTP (v0.2.0), we'll need:

```python
# Minimal HTTP transport requirements
- aiohttp >= 3.9.0
- JSON-RPC routing
- Proper async handling
- Session management
- CORS configuration
- Origin validation (security)
- Rate limiting
```

## The Brutally Honest Approach

This decision exemplifies our philosophy:

- **Working code > Broken features**
- **Honest limitations > False promises**
- **Solid foundation > Feature creep**

## For Contributors

Want to add HTTP transport? Great! But remember:

1. Start with a working implementation
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Document honestly
4. Don't break stdio

## Conclusion

NetworkX MCP Server v0.1.0 is **proudly stdio-only**. It does one thing and does it well. When we add HTTP, it will be because we can do it right, not because we want to check a box.
