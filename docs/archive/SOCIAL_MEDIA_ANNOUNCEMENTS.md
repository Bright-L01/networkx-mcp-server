## 💼 LinkedIn Announcement

🎉 Excited to announce the launch of NetworkX MCP Server v1.0.0!

After months of development, I'm proud to share the first NetworkX integration for Model Context Protocol, enabling graph analysis directly in AI conversations.

🔍 **What makes this special:**
• First-to-market in the MCP ecosystem
• 13 essential graph operations (centrality, community detection, PageRank)
• Real-time graph visualization
• Zero setup required with Claude Desktop

🎯 **Perfect for professionals in:**
• Social network analysis
• Transportation and logistics
• Knowledge management
• Data science and research

💡 **Real-world impact:**
Instead of switching between tools, you can now analyze networks, identify key nodes, detect communities, and visualize results all through natural language conversations with AI.

The package is live on PyPI and ready for production use with comprehensive testing and documentation.

🚀 Get started: `pip install networkx-mcp-server`

## 📖 Reddit Post (r/MachineLearning, r/datascience, r/Python)

**Title**: [P] NetworkX MCP Server v1.0.0 - Graph analysis in AI conversations

**Content**:

I just released the first NetworkX integration for Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling graph analysis directly in AI conversations.

**What it does:**
- 13 graph operations: centrality measures, community detection, PageRank, shortest paths
- Graph visualization with multiple layouts (spring, circular, kamada_kawai)
- Import/export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- Works seamlessly with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

**Why this matters:**
Instead of writing code → running analysis → interpreting results, you can now just describe what you want to analyze in natural language. Perfect for exploratory data analysis and rapid prototyping.

**Real examples:**
- "Find the most influential people in this social network"
- "Identify bottlenecks in this transportation network"  
- "Map prerequisite relationships in this curriculum"

**Technical details:**
- Built on NetworkX 3.0+
- 26 comprehensive tests (100% coverage)
- ~70MB memory footprint (includes visualization)
- Production-ready with proper error handling

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install networkx-mcp-server
```

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/Bright-L01/networkx-mcp-server
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/networkx-mcp-server/
- Demo scripts included for social networks, transportation, and knowledge graphs

Would love feedback from the community! This is just v1.0 and there's lots of room for additional algorithms and features.

## 📧 Email Template for NetworkX Community

**Subject**: NetworkX MCP Server - Graph analysis in AI conversations

**Body**:

Hi NetworkX community,

I wanted to share something I've been working on that might interest users who want to integrate NetworkX with AI workflows.

I've just released NetworkX MCP Server v1.0.0, which enables NetworkX graph analysis through natural language conversations with AI models like Claude.

**What it provides:**
- Direct access to NetworkX algorithms through Model Context Protocol
- 13 essential operations: centrality measures, community detection, PageRank, etc.
- Graph visualization capabilities
- Natural language interface for exploratory analysis

**Example workflow:**
Instead of writing Python code to analyze a network, you can now say:
"Load this social network data and find the most central nodes"
"Detect communities and visualize the results"
"Calculate PageRank and identify the top influencers"

**For the NetworkX ecosystem:**
This makes NetworkX more accessible to non-programmers and enables rapid prototyping of graph analysis workflows. It's particularly useful for education, research, and business analysis scenarios.

**Technical details:**
- Built on NetworkX 3.0+
- Available on PyPI: `pip install networkx-mcp-server`
- Open source with comprehensive documentation
- Production-ready with full test coverage

**Repository:** https://github.com/Bright-L01/networkx-mcp-server

I'd appreciate any feedback from the community. The goal is to make NetworkX's powerful capabilities more accessible through natural language interfaces.

Best regards,
[Your name]
