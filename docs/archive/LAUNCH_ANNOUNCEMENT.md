# 🚀 NetworkX MCP Server v1.0.0 - Now Live on PyPI!

**The first NetworkX integration for Model Context Protocol** has officially launched!

## 🎉 What's New

After months of development and brutal honesty about what actually works, we're proud to announce that **NetworkX MCP Server v1.0.0** is now available on PyPI.

### 🔥 What Makes This Special

- **First-to-Market**: The only NetworkX server in the MCP ecosystem
- **13 Essential Operations**: From basic graph creation to advanced algorithms like PageRank and community detection
- **Graph Visualization**: See your networks with PNG output and multiple layouts
- **Zero Setup**: Works immediately with Claude Desktop
- **Natural Language**: Analyze graphs through conversation, not code

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install networkx-mcp-server
```

## 🎯 What You Can Do

### Social Network Analysis
```
Human: Create a social network and find the most influential people

Claude: [Creates graph with social connections]
[Calculates degree centrality]
Most influential: Alice (connected to 75% of the network)
[Shows visualization]
```

### Transportation Planning
```
Human: Analyze this city's road network for bottlenecks

Claude: [Imports road network from CSV]
[Calculates betweenness centrality]
Critical intersection: Downtown Hub (handles 60% of traffic flow)
[Visualizes network with bottlenecks highlighted]
```

### Knowledge Graph Analysis
```
Human: Map prerequisite relationships in this curriculum

Claude: [Creates directed graph of courses]
[Finds shortest learning path]
Path to AI: Math → Programming → Algorithms → Machine Learning
[Shows course dependency visualization]
```

## 🏆 By the Numbers

- **13 Graph Operations**: Core, analysis, visualization, and I/O
- **26 Comprehensive Tests**: 100% coverage maintained
- **~70MB Memory**: Includes full visualization capabilities
- **Millisecond Performance**: For most operations (1-2s for visualization)
- **First-to-Market**: No competition in this space

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

### Core Operations
- `create_graph`, `add_nodes`, `add_edges`, `get_info`, `shortest_path`

### Analysis Operations  
- `degree_centrality`, `betweenness_centrality`, `pagerank`, `connected_components`, `community_detection`

### Visualization & I/O
- `visualize_graph` (PNG with spring, circular, kamada_kawai layouts)
- `import_csv`, `export_json`

## 📚 Resources

- **PyPI Package**: https://pypi.org/project/networkx-mcp-server/
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/Bright-L01/networkx-mcp-server
- **Demo Scripts**: [Social networks, transportation, knowledge graphs](demos/)
- **Documentation**: Complete API reference and examples

## 🎯 For Claude Desktop Users

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "networkx": {
      "command": "networkx-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop and start analyzing graphs naturally!
