### Known Issues/Limitations

1. **Integration Test Compatibility**: Some integration tests fail due to API method naming changes (`handle_message` vs `handle_request`). This is a test compatibility issue, not a functional problem.

2. **BibTeX Quality**: While BibTeX export works, some entries have empty metadata fields, likely due to incomplete DOI metadata from external APIs.

3. **Network Dependency**: Academic features require internet connectivity for DOI resolution via CrossRef API.
