## Key Improvements

1. **Specific Exception Types**: Where possible, used specific exception types like:
   - `nx.PowerIterationFailedConvergence` for centrality algorithms
   - `nx.NetworkXError` for general NetworkX operations
   - `ValueError` for value conversion issues
   - `RecursionError` and `MemoryError` for computational limits
   - `JSONDecodeError` and `KeyError` for data parsing

2. **Logging**: Added debug-level logging for all exceptions to aid in debugging without disrupting normal operation

3. **Error Context**: All log messages include context about what operation failed and why

4. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintained the original fallback behavior while adding proper error tracking

## Benefits

- Improved debugging capabilities with detailed error logs
- Better understanding of failure modes in production
- Compliance with Python best practices (PEP 8)
- Easier maintenance and troubleshooting
